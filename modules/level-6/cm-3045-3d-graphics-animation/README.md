# 3D Graphics and Animation (CM3045)

This module will cover advanced methods used in current state-of-the-art
graphics and animation systems. It will include the mathematical
foundations, computational techniques and their use in creative
practice. By taking this module, you will learn how to write programs
that generate animated 3D graphics. There are several distinct study
areas: 3D modelling and animation, the graphics pipeline, simulation
of physics and shader programming. You will study a range of examples,
and through these learn how you can program computer graphics in
contemporary graphical software for different applications.

## Topics covered

- Overview of 3D Graphics and mathematics for graphics
- 3D Models and Transforms
- Physics simulation
- Keyframe Animation
- Character Animation
